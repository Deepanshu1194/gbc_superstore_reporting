# 📊 GBC Superstore Sales Analysis Project

🎯 Project Objective:

The goal is to create insightful business reports that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by analyzing sales, profit margins, and shipping efficiency.

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive data analysis pipeline for the GBC Superstore sales dataset.
